X11 cursors
===========

What
----

A collection of old-school X11 cursors that I like.

Why
---

Because AFAIK these is the only way to get these cursors. Ideally, someone with artistic inclinations would make them into a state-of-the-art modern cursor theme. Until then, this is it.

How
---

You invoke make in the source directory. By default it builds the 48x48 cursors scaling the original 32x32 source. Invoking it as `make 32` will build the 32x32 cursors.
